# Softbody Frog Procedural Animation

After watching the video by [@argonautcode](https://www.youtube.com/@argonautcode) [on his video of soft-body procedural animation][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXh0Vxg7AnQ], I decided to [clone his code](https://github.com/argonautcode/soft-body-proc-anim) using plain old JavaScript!

It is well known at work that I love frogs, and everyone who knows me personally can confirm this as a fact.
